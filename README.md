Key integrations include Razorpay for payment processing, Meilisearch for fast search functionality, and SendGrid with React Email for email notifications.

## **Project Objective**
The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies and to develop a comprehensive understanding of building and integrating various components required for a functional e-commerce platform. This project was completed as part of our internship at Cybernaut Edu-Tech LLP.
